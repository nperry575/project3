	<u><h1 align="center">Theory of a prosperious civilization</h1></u>
<p align="center">A prosperous civilization is always an organized, well run, and fair one.
	Our civilization is named Nakenemma.
	Nakenemma is a well organized society that has excellent battle tactics,
	nice social standings, good economy, and much more to offer the citizens of Nakenemma.</P>
	
	
		<p align="center">In the civilization of <mark>Nakenemma</mark> they live in a society where everyone is seen equally it doesn't matter what color or gender you are. 
		The political aspect of Nakenemma involves a council of 300 that makes important decisions for the city. 
		Our 4% literacy rate is higher then all of the other territories this leads to our women, men, and children being able to go to the library and be intelligent, and gain new knowledge. 
		This of course excludes slaves because we need to have someone to build the things we want to build for our civilization. 
		The political aspect of our civilization is simple, we have two main kings that make decisions but of course take into consideration the opinions from the council of 300. 
		The way we choose are kings is in the form of a monarchy the title and position is passed down from family. 
		The motto of Nakenemma is “do no wrong live by right, if you do wrong you shall be punished”. 
		This motto is similar to those of the egyptians. 
		The intellectual part of Nakenemma includes 2 gods and 2 creators we are a polytheistic society that accepts all people but have main gods we believe in. 
		Our creators the goddesses Emily and Johanna, our god of the underworld Kenny, and 6 god the creator of lies and mayhem. 
		They worshipped these immortals in a three day festival called Glastonbury they praised those gods and sacrifice sheep near the ocean. 
		The people of Nakenemma were incredibly brilliant even the slaves, yes the slaves weren't able to become citizens but we are fair and allow them to learn in order to gain new knowledge and also train in case we need them for battle. 
		We gave slaves this opportunity to learn and train because slaves were the ones who gave us ideas of medicine by mixing herbs from the mountains together. 
		This is one of the ways that we keep our slaves happy and from revolting we let them learn and train with citizens of Nakennema. 
		Lastly the way that our civilization makes its money is by trading with other territories. We have a lot of farming land which leads to us having a lot of crops to trade. 
		Trading is very simple for us since our way of transportation is by boat. We also raid other territories to get supplies we need to build and farm. 
		Our group theory of how a civilization is able to prosper is simple. The civilians of the society must learn how to read and write, have good battle tactics, stable economy, and finally having a surplus of food and the regular necessities everyone needs. From all three of these reasons we can conclude that the civilization would be an intellectual one, a well armed, wealthy, and will have a surplus of food and supplies. Our group is able to use their intellectual side to their advantage because we made a lighthouse which shows our civilization was a smart one because the lighthouse shows other civilizations that this is our territory and it also significates that our ocean was there and our ports would be there. The battle tactics of Nakenemma are very similar to those of the Vikings. We are a naval based army where we go out on longboats and plunder and raid other civilizations. With this successful battle tactic we are able to take the supplies our civilization needs like, wood, iron, and other types of crops other than grapes and olives. Another benefit from this battle tactic is that we add to the surplus of food we have. It may take a while for our supplies to get back to the village, but it adds to all the food we need and have in our village which means we can have other jobs such as blacksmiths, teachers, and many other jobs that we need in order to prosper, and conquer other civilizations. With all these jobs the economy would be incredibly stable because no one is having to pay more money or trade more valuable items for such little things like food or weapons. Our economy works much like the vikings which means we go set up trading ports in other territories, and trade our valuable items for their valuable items. This means since we trade across territories we will get different types of valuable items and we could use those valuable items to trade with another group and get their stuff which means our civilizations could have iron, wood, and other types of currency from different villages other than our silver coins we use. 
With all the reasons listed above we can conclude that the civilization of Nakenemma is a prosperous, well armed, and intelligent civilization. This society could end up conquering other civilizations in a heartbeat.
