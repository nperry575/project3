<title>	monuments</title>
	<p align="center">The civilization of Nakenemma has three monuments a library, colosseum, and a light house. 
	These are the things that keep our people connected. 
	The library shows us that even though we are a war based civilization constantly fighting isn’t all that we are capable of. 
	Our civilization is actually very intelligent. 
	We have to think things through like our battle strategies and use our knowledge, to figure out certain ways for our civilization to be prosperous. 
	The lighthouse shows us that no matter how low we are that there is still light in all of us. 
	The lighthouse is Nakenemma´s beacon of hope and prosperity. 
	When our hopes are low and we think we have nothing else to live for we have to remind ourselves that there is room to have a brighter future. 
	That there is still hope for all of us. The colosseum is a reminder of our people's culture. 
	It is a place for our people to gather and have festivals,battles,and other festivities. 
	The colosseum is a way for our people to get back in touch with their roots and reconnect themselves with their ancestors.  </P>
