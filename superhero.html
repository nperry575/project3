<p>My story is related to the comic book series deadpool.That's where I got my inspiration for my story. I wanted my hero to have a dark background, because those are the people that you want to win because they have gone through the struggles of life. I also wanted this because those people are always the under dog.</p>


<p>Super power:is unable to feel physical pain</p>
<p>Pros of this power. He can push his body to impossible limits</p>
<p>Cons of this power: his body still retains the damage that is done so he has to be carful on how far he pushes his body and how much damage he takes</p>
